  /*
   * Use Case:
   *
   * 1. User clicks on the "Change" button.
   *
   * 2. If the text input is blank then nothing changes.
   *
   * 3. The contents of the <h1> element are replaced with the contents
   *    of the text input.
   *
   * 4. The text input is cleared.
   *
   * BONUS 1:
   *
   * Before step 3 above: Save the current text content of the <h1>
   * element by creating an <li> element.  Set the text content of the
   * <li> element to the text content of the <h1> element.  Find the
   * <ul> element with the ID of "history" and insert the new <li>
   * element as its first child.  Therefore, each time the <h1>
   * element is changed, its current value is prepended to the <ul>
   * element.
   *
   * BONUS 2:
   *
   * If one of the <li> elements inside the <ul> element from bonus 1
   * is clicked, update the text content of the <h1> element with the
   * text content of the clicked <li> element.
